__Goal__ : 
To create a vedio story using AI.


We used __Text to Image tool that is Based on CLIP + FFT from Lucent and made by Vadim Epstein __ to create artificial artwork from the story _Old Man Lived in the Village_, by feeding the tool with sentences and letting it create the of the final video.

The following sentences used generate the clips. The length for each clip was 0.12 seconds.

* Happy people in the village. Angry Old man in a village.
* Angry Old man in village sad Old man.
* Old man unfortunate and out of luck. 
* Old man alone.
* Old man Birthday.

Then we combined all the clips and add the voiceover.

* Arabic Voiceover: Maha AlQroon
* English Voiceover: Asmaa Alrefae
